## 🎯 Course Description

This course is an introduction to the probability theory and statistical inference for undergraduates in engineering and the sciences. This course attempts to provide basic concepts of set theory, central tendency, dispersion and different approaches of conceptualizing probability. It discusses useful laws of probability, Bayes rule, random variables and their distribution. It also covers discussions on certain operators like mathematical expectation, variance of random variables and probability distributions such as Binomial, Geometric, Negative Binomial, Poisson, Uniform, Normal, Exponential and their applications. It focuses on sampling distribution, single mean test and preliminary ideas on test of hypothesis.
